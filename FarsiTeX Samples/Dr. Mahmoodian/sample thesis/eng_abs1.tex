In a combinatorial structure S, a substructure D is said to be a {\bf defining set}, if
 S is the only structure containing D.
Those defining sets which 
have no proper defining subset, have special importance in combinatorics, because of their 
applications. These sets have been called {\bf critical sets}
in Latin squares, {\bf defining sets} in combinatorial designs, and {\bf forcing sets}
in the diverse concepts of graphs.\\
In this project, we review the bounds obtained for the volume of the critical sets
 in Latin squares.\\
In Chapter 1, we collected the necessary definitions for studying critical sets.
In Chapter 2, we state the theorems and bounds for the volume of these sets.
Chapter 3 has a review on the volume of critical sets based on a group, in particular,
cyclic group ${\Bbb Z}_n$, abelian 2-groups, abelian 3-groups, and dihedral groups.
Direct product of Latin squares and their critical sets are studied in Chapter 4.
Applications of critical sets are discussed in the last chapter.\\
Also, in the Appendices (A) and (B), respectively, we have listed all of the papers
 about
defining sets in combinatorial designs and the defining (forcing) sets in graphs.
At the end, we also have collected papers about  critical sets in Latin squares,
 in Appendix (C) that
 we haven't referred to them in the text of the project.
