                     FarsiTeX Distribution Guide


Welcome to FarsiTeX!

FarsiTeX is a typesetting system based on Donald Knuth's TeX. It accepts
almost all commands of TeX and LaTeX 2.09 in multi-lingual
Persian/Latin modes and produces the device independent output,
which can be processed by many available device drivers.


Current Version
===============
The main components of FarsiTeX in this distribution are:

	macros			version 1.0 beta
	[TODO: add other packages]

Please read "changes.txt" for the new features of this release.

This is the beta version of FarsiTeX. Although it has been extensively
used for many years prior to this release, we don't claim or guarantee
that it is free of any bug. After receiving bug reports, we will
release its stable version.


Manual
======
The FarsiTeX system is described in:

  A Guide to FarsiTeX, by Mohammad Ghodsi and Roozbeh Pournader,
  Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology,
  1997 (in Persian)

Computer-readable versions of this manual is included with this release.

However, the LaTeX 2.09 book should be considered as the main reference
manual for FarsiTeX (Leslie Lamport, LaTeX: A document Preparation
System, first edition, Addison-Weseley, 1985.) So, if you are already
familiar with LaTeX, you can easily start using FarsiTeX.
